  <h4>Project linkage is an experiment about human trust</h4>
  <p>
    A number of initial participants received coins with an individual QR code on the back. They have five basic tasks:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hand this coin to a person they trust
    <li>Have a conversation about their mutual relationship
    <li>Scan the QR code and document the handover
    <li>Write a short text about their conversation for everyone to read
    <li>Request that the receiving person repeats these five steps
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, we create chains based on human trust. And tell our stories.</p>
