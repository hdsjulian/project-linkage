  Project linkage is an experiment about human trust. 
</p>
<p>
  A number of initial participants received coins with an individual QR code on the back. They have five basic tasks:
</p>
<p>Hand this coin to a person they trust</p>
<p>Have a conversation about their mutual relationship</p>
<p>Scan the QR code and document the handover</p>   
<p>Write a short text about their conversation for everyone to read</p> 
<p>Request that the receiving person repeats these five steps </p>  
<p>Thus, we create chains based on human trust. And tell our stories.
